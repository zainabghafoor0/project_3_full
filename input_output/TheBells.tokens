the
bells
hear
the
sledges
with
the
bells
silver
bells
what
a
world
of
merriment
their
melody
foretells
how
they
tinkle
tinkle
tinkle
in
the
icy
air
of
night

the
stars
that
oversprinkle
all
the
heavens
seem
to
twinkle
with
a
crystalline
delight
keeping
time
time
time
in
a
sort
of
runic
rhyme
to
the
tintinnabulation
that
so
musically
wells
from
the
bells

bells
from
the
jingling
and
the
tinkling
of
the
